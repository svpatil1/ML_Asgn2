###### Goal:
Defining the objective function and optimizing it.

###### Implementation:
The following algorithms were implemented on MovieLens 100k Data,

1. Stochastic gradient descent algorithm
2. Gradient descent algorithm

###### Observation:
When the dataset is large, Stochastic gradient descent algorithm should be used instead of Gradient descent algorithm beacause in gradient descent algoritm, for performing a single update towards global minimum, it has to run through all the data points.

Whereas, in stochastic gradient descent algorithm, it performs the above update for each training example.
